Herald was a side project that I was using to create an AI powered local newspaper. 

In effect, trying to answer the question: `Can I create a hyperlocal Twitter alternative that used AI to shield me from things I did not want to see or actively show me content I did want to see?`

It also uses Dall-E to create mini little comics which I thought were fun.
